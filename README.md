# marktheline

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

An addin package that mimics the (hidden) line marking shortcut
available in the RStudio API and exposes it so it can be assigned to a
new keyboard binding.

Why would you do this? To prevent conflicts with the
`devtools::load_all()` shortcut that is associated to the same keyboard
binding (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+L`).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("mpaulacaldas/marktheline")
```
