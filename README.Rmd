# marktheline

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An addin package that mimics the (hidden) line marking shortcut available in the RStudio API and exposes it so it can be assigned to a new keyboard binding.

Why would you do this? To prevent conflicts with the `devtools::load_all()` shortcut that is associated to the same keyboard binding (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+L`).
